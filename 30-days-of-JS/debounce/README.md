## Explanation

The debounce method creates a debounced version of another function. The debounced function, when invoked, will only execute the original function after a specified delay (t). If the debounced function is called multiple times within the delay period, only the last call will be considered, and the previous calls will be ignored. This is useful for scenarios where you want to ensure that a function is not called too frequently, such as handling user input or event listeners.

```ts
function debounce(fn: F, t: number): F {
  let timerId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>;

  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timerId);
    timerId = setTimeout(() => {
      fn(...args);
    }, t);
  };
}
```

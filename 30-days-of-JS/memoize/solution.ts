/** 
 * let callCount = 0;
 * const memoizedFn = memoize(function (a, b) {
 *	 callCount += 1;
 *   return a + b;
 * })
 * memoizedFn(2, 3) // 5
 * memoizedFn(2, 3) // 5
 * console.log(callCount) // 1 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:

Input:
fnName = "sum"
actions = ["call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
values = [[2,2],[2,2],[],[1,2],[]]
Output: [4,4,1,3,2]
Explanation:
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const memoizedSum = memoize(sum);
memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. sum() was called as (2, 2) was not seen before.
memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. However sum() was not called because the same inputs were seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
memoizedSum(1, 2); // "call" - returns 3. sum() was called as (1, 2) was not seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
Example 2:

Input:
fnName = "factorial"
actions = ["call","call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
values = [[2],[3],[2],[],[3],[]]
Output: [2,6,2,2,6,2]
Explanation:
const factorial = (n) => (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
const memoFactorial = memoize(factorial);
memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2.
memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6.
memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2. However factorial was not called because 2 was seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6. However factorial was not called because 3 was seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
Example 3:

Input:
fnName = "fib"
actions = ["call","getCallCount"]
values = [[5],[]]
Output: [8,1]
Explanation:
fib(5) = 8 // "call"
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 1

Constraints:

0 <= a, b <= 105
1 <= n <= 10
0 <= actions.length <= 105
actions.length === values.length
actions[i] is one of "call" and "getCallCount"
fnName is one of "sum", "factorial" and "fib"

## Explanation

The join function takes two arrays of objects (arr1 and arr2), where each object has an id property with an integer value. The function merges the arrays based on the id property. If two objects share the same id, their properties are merged into a single object.

```typescript
function join(arr1: JSONValue[], arr2: JSONValue[]): JSONValue[] {
  const result: unknown = {};

  for (const obj of arr1) {
    result[obj['id']] = obj;
  }

  for (const obj of arr2) {
    if (result[obj['id']]) {
      for (const key in obj as IObjectProperty) {
        result[obj['id']][key] = obj[key];
      }
    } else {
      result[obj['id']] = obj;
    }
  }

  return Object.values(result);
}
```

Here's a step-by-step summary:

- Initialize an empty result object to store the merged objects.

- Iterate through arr1 and add each object to result using its id as the key.

- Iterate through arr2:

  - If an object with the same id already exists in result, merge the properties of the current object from arr2 into the existing object in result.

  - If the object with the same id doesn't exist in result, add the entire object from arr2 to result.

- Convert the values of the result object to an array and return it.

The function essentially combines the objects from both arrays, ensuring that objects with the same id are merged, and the resulting array is sorted based on the id values in ascending order.

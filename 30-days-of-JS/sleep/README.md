## Explanation

This method returns a Promise that will be resolved after the specified duration `millis` has passed. This is often used in asynchronous programming to introduce delays or pauses between operations.

```ts
async function sleep(millis: number): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve();
    }, millis);
  });
}
```

## Explanation

Check for Empty Array:

```ts
if (functions?.length === 0) {
  return function (x) {
    return x;
  };
}
```
This part of the code checks if the functions array is null or has a length of 0. If it is, the compose function returns a new function that takes an argument x and simply returns x. This is a base case for the composition of functions. If there are no functions to compose, the composed function is essentially the identity function.

Compose Functions:

```ts
return function (x) {
  let result = x;
  for (let i = functions?.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    result = functions[i](result);
  }
  return result;
};
```

If the functions array is not empty, the code defines a new function. This function takes an argument x, which represents the input to the composed functions.

Inside the function, there's a loop that iterates over the array of functions in reverse order. The loop starts from the last function and goes backward until the first function (i >= 0). 

In each iteration, it applies the current function to the result and updates the result with the output of that function.

After the loop completes, the final result of the composition is returned. This result represents the output of applying all the functions in the array in reverse order.

## Explanation


This method allows you to group elements of an array based on a specified grouping function.

This code extends the Array prototype by adding a new method named groupBy. The method takes a function fn as its argument.

Inside the groupBy method, it initializes an empty object obj to store the grouped elements. It then iterates through each element of the array (this). For each element, it calculates a key by applying the provided function (fn) to the element. If the key does not exist in the obj, it initializes an empty array for that key. It then pushes the current element to the array corresponding to the key.

The ||= is the logical nullish assignment operator, which means that if the left operand is null or undefined, the right operand is assigned to the left operand. It's a shorthand way of ensuring that the array for a particular key is initialized before pushing elements to it.


```ts
Array.prototype.groupBy = function (fn) {
  const obj: Record<string, string[]> = {};
  for (const item of this) {
    const key = fn(item);
    obj[key] ||= [];
    obj[key].push(item);
  }
  return obj;
};
```
